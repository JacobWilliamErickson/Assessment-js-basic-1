// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const Analysis = "This is where you take a detailed look at what it is you want your code to accomplish and what the end goal is. Also research any functions or anything we think we will need that we may not be familiar with"

const Design = "This is where you take a look at the Analysis we made in the previous step and then plan out how we are going to accomplish it. Right any sudocode we think would be helpful to start the code"

const Implementation = "This is where we implement the Analysis and Design we have set up and type our code, keeping our code clean consise and readable to any of other developers leaving more sudo code where neccesary"

const TestingIntergration = "This is where you run a series of test cases making sure your code is achieving the function desired. Bug testing also taking place where you try to break your code by typing unexpected inputs, etc. and fixing the mistakes or bugs you find as you go or making bug reports and going back to the code after and fixing all the problems you find, repeating as much as needed and then releases your code for its function whether that is publishing it to the internet, loading it to the machine or pushing it up to github"

const Maintain = "After finishing your testing and Intergrate it, others may find bugs you could not or other additional requests may be added to the requirements this is where you dive back in and make those changes"
